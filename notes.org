* Ideas
** notion-wm-repl-mode
   Could be full blown, or simpler variant where output from evaled code was inserted below. (In that case a separate mode might be unnecessary
* Possible tasks
** TODO make completion work inside string
   (since keybinding configuration typically happens with lua-in-string)
** TODO use a mechanism (execution notionflux) that exposes the output from stderr too, allowing better user feedback
* Bugs / weaknesses
** Only first return value of function is returned
   Eg. when using notion-wm-cmd.
   Not sure if this is a bug in notionflux or not
* WIP 
** Better documentation lookup by traversing the meta-table hierarchy
